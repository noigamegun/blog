Here it is my list of things I bought and made their money back or saved me lots of time and headaches.

## [Webcam - Logitech C920](https://www.gearbest.com/webcams/pp_3003219570150236.html?wid=2000001&lkid=79737884)

A good webcam is key nowadays. The [Logitech C920](https://www.gearbest.com/webcams/pp_3003219570150236.html?wid=2000001&lkid=79737884) is the most used one around the world. It's a great camera that will last you for a long time. If you want to be future proof you can go with the new Logitech C920 4K but the [1080p version](https://www.gearbest.com/webcams/pp_3003219570150236.html?wid=2000001&lkid=79737884) is more than enough! The camera has really good image quality and it has a great "angle adjustment system" as well as a tripod screw hole on the bottom. This screw hole is universal for any tripod. (1/4")

## [Robot Vacuum - Roborock S5 Max](https://www.gearbest.com/vacuum-cleaners/pp_3004808242678763.html?wid=2000001&lkid=79737898)

At about 400‚Ç¨ (\$475) it's a harder sell but it saves you so much time cleaning! If you have pets or children or if you hate cleaning having a robot vacuum is a must! You can program it to clean every day at a given time. You could wake up to a clean floor. I recommend you buy the [Robot Vacuum - Roborock S5 Max](https://www.gearbest.com/vacuum-cleaners/pp_3004808242678763.html?wid=2000001&lkid=79737898) from Xiaomi. I have mine set to clean my office at 1 pm every day. I spend my day here and my cat also has his bed in my office, so this is a must-have to keep the place clean of fur, dust, dirt, etc.

## [Bluetooth Headphones - Bluedio T5S](https://www.gearbest.com/bluetooth-headphones/pp_1826577.html?wid=1527929&lkid=79738082)

There are so many Bluetooth Headphones on the market that you are probably wondering why I recommend the [Bluetooth Headphones - Bluedio T5S](https://www.gearbest.com/bluetooth-headphones/pp_1826577.html?wid=1527929&lkid=79738082) ü§î. It's simple: battery and Bluetooth. They have days of nonstop listening! [I'm an avid podcast listener](https://blog.rodrigograca.com/why-do-i-listen-to-these-podcasts/) and sometimes spend the entire day using these headphones to listen (8+ hours), then the next day they still have a charge for another entire day! Not to mention that they charge through USB C! üòÆ I can use my phone cable! Other than that they are conformable and sound good.

## [Keyboard - Motospeed GK89](https://www.gearbest.com/keyboards/pp_009986566823.html?lkid=79738082)

Don't buy any keyboard, buy a sturdy one that will last you years if not decades! I have the [Motospeed GK89.](https://www.gearbest.com/keyboards/pp_009986566823.html?lkid=79738082)

The main thing you should look for is a keyboard that will hold up over time. Bonus points if you get a wireless one that allows you to move freely and type from anywhere, or just lift it from the table to clean faster.

## [Mouse (wireless and with extra buttons)](https://www.gearbest.com/mice-keyboards-c_11261/?lkid=79738082)

On the other hand, (pun intended üòÇ), you have your mouse. Find one that has at least 2 extra buttons, most of them have back and forward buttons. This allows you to navigate between pages or folders much faster, saving you time, paying itself over time. [Here are a few options](https://www.gearbest.com/mice-keyboards-c_11261/?lkid=79738082) and once again bonus points of you get a wireless mouse because you will have an easier time using it.

## [Rechargeable batteries (AAA, AA)](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Rechargeable-Batteries-8-Pack-Pre-charged/dp/B00CWNMXQW/)

[These are life-saving!](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Rechargeable-Batteries-8-Pack-Pre-charged/dp/B00CWNMXQW/) They are a great complimentary item for the wireless mouse. That means you will have to buy a mouse that uses AAA batteries. That way when they are dead you just swap them and done.
But my main point is that if you have a few rechargeable batteries around you will never run out of them again. Because wherever they die you swap them and recharge the previous ones, then you can swap again. No need to buy them ever again!

I recommend you buy the [AmazonBasics AAA Rechargeable Batteries - Pack of 8](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Rechargeable-Batteries-8-Pack-Pre-charged/dp/B00CWNMXQW/) or [AmazonBasics AA High-Capacity - Pack of 8](amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Capacity-Rechargeable-Batteries-Pre-charged/dp/B00HZV9WTM/) if you need AAs and lastly the [AmazonBasics AAA & AA Charger With USB Port](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Battery-Charger-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B00TOVTZ7K/) if you don't have one yet.

## Weights üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Yes, weights. Why? Because however much they cost they will still be weights after years of use if you decide to sell them. Also because it will allow you to stay active and healthy. That's invaluable.

## Phone case

Have you ever dropped a phone? You probably did! And you probably found out how much it costs to replace the phone screen. Probably a few hundred, 100‚Ç¨? 200‚Ç¨? more? However much it was you could probably have saved that money if you had a phone case. I recommend you search for a rugged case for your phone model that has some thick rubber protecting the corners. Try [searching here for your phone model](https://www.gearbest.com/cases-covers-c_12010/?lkid=79739003) Yes a phone with the case might not look as pretty but your wallet will thank you!

## Good computer

If you work all day on a computer you should buy a powerful computer. It will save you countless hours of waiting. And as we know, time is money.

(I will be writing a post about my computer and setup)

## SSD

In the same vein as a good computer, if you still have an HDD you are in for a treat! The performance difference is so big that you will think you got a new computer! No joke!

I've upgraded several of my computers to the [SAMSUNG 860 EVO](https://www.gearbest.com/other-laptop-accessories/pp_3006000655912927.html?wid=2000001&lkid=79739003) and my main production machine has a [SAMSUNG  970 EVO NVMe M.2](https://www.gearbest.com/other-laptop-accessories/pp_3007453807470740.html?wid=2000001&lkid=79739003) which is even faster! üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Furniture!

<!-- ??? IKEA affiliate link? -->

Even [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/) furniture! I'm not joking! Think about it: if you buy a table and 2 drawers, and a chair, you can use it to eat, store things, work, etc etc. 2 years ago I bought 2 tabletops, 3 drawers, etc, it cost me about 300‚Ç¨ and it will probably last me my life. It helps me a lot to have my things organized in the drawers and use the table to work every day.

I will make a post about my remote work setup!

## Land

Yes, land! Dirt. Land or real estate always goes up in price over the years. You might think it is a heavy investment right now but in 10 or 20 years you will be able to sell it for way more!

## [Good cables](https://www.banggood.com/buy/blitzwolf-cable.html?p=NC24131288230201502F)

Everyone has had the typical cheap USB cable that breaks and you just buy another cheap one and breaks again. Stop doing that! Next time buy a proper USB cable, thick and sturdy. If possible upgrade everything to USB C too! I would recommend you buy the [BlitzWolf cables](https://www.banggood.com/buy/blitzwolf-cable.html?p=NC24131288230201502F), they will last you forever!

### Conclusion:

This is an ever-growing list of things I bought and used for years before deciding they are worth the money.
