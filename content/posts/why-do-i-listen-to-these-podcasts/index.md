### The Joe Rogan Experience

**Type:** Audio

**Why I listen:** "To expand my wisdom". I don't even know how to explain. If you don't know Joe Rogan you are in for a treat. Its probably considered the number 1 podcast in the world. He has had guests like Elon Musk, Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Mike Tyson, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Tim Ferriss, and many other well-known people. His topics range from health, philosophy, science, comedy, to virtually any topic. He sits down and talks to his guests for hours.

### Smart Passive Income

**Type:** Audio

**Why I listen:** I would say this is the number 1 podcast if you are into blogging, marketing, passive income, online business, affiliates, podcasting, etc. Pat Flynn has been a great inspiration throughout the years. He brings guests on to talk about how and what they are doing to provide value in their niche. His site content has been a fantastic resource over the years if you do online business. (It's a birds-eye view)

### FLOSS Weekly

**Type:** Audio

**Why I listen:** Like the name says every week they talk about FLOSS (Free Libre Open Source Software). Usually, they bring a project or a person on and ask all kinds of questions like "How the project is structured?", "How it's funded?", "What's the license?", "Who is it for?", "How they do it?", "How it was started?", "Whos behind?", "What they currently need help with?". This allows me to discover new projects/tools that I would not otherwise. Also keeps me up to date on what people are doing and using.

### Syntax

**Type:** Audio

**Why I listen:** I listen to keep up with what and how people are doing Web Development nowadays. They pick one topic and discuss it, analyzing the alternatives, how they do it, and why. They also answer lots of general web dev questions that viewers send. If you are a web developer this is the number 1 podcast. Scott Tolinski and Wes Bos are 2 very well known developers in the JavaScript world. They have multiple courses that range from free to paid.

### The Polyglot Developer

**Type:** Audio

**Why I listen:** Monthly

**Duration:** 1 Hour

It turns any article into audio and gives you a podcast feed as output.

Note: I don't listen to all episodes of all podcasts. That would be impossible.

[If you want all my podcasts as an OPML file here it is.](./podcasts_opml.xml)

The App I use to listen is [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/)

**Pro tips:**

1. Enable "Trim Silence". (It has saved me 15 hours so far! üòÆ)

2. Increase the "Speed" setting. I got it at 1.1x. This also saves you hours!

3. Enable "Auto download" and "Add to Up Next" on the podcasts you love and every morning they will be downloaded and on your playlist ready to be played.

4. Use a widget to have quick access to your player. This allows you to start listening without having to open the App first.

Hopefully, you have discovered some new podcasts to listen to! [Tweet at me](https://twitter.com/rodrigograca31) the podcasts you listen to!
